# Neapolitan Domain Switcher - Browser Extension Demo

Neapolitan Domain Switcher is a Chrome and Safari extension that helps developers, QA testers, and technical teams easily switch between environments. This quick demo shows how the extension works in two ways:

1. Using the popup menu to switch between production (vanilla), staging (strawberry), and development (chocolate) environments
2. Using keyboard shortcuts (Alt+W, Alt+S, Alt+X) to instantly switch between the same environments

The extension preserves your current URL path, query parameters, and hash fragments when switching environments, saving time and preventing mistakes during development and testing.
