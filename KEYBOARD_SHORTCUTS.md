# Keyboard Shortcuts Guide

Keyboard shortcuts can significantly speed up your workflow when switching between environments. Chrome extensions can suggest shortcuts, but **cannot automatically set them** for security reasons.

## Configuration Instructions

To configure keyboard shortcuts for this extension:

1. **On Chrome**: Type `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` in your browser's address bar  
   **On Safari**: Go to Safari > Settings > Extensions > Select this extension > Shortcuts
2. Find "Neapolitan Domain Switcher" in the list
3. Click the pencil icon next to any command to set or change its shortcut
4. Press your desired key combination

**Note:** Chrome doesn't allow extensions to create direct links to `chrome://` URLs for security reasons. In Safari, you can access extension shortcuts through the Settings menu.

## Recommended Shortcut Schemes
